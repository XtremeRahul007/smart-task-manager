# Smart Task Manager

A modern, offline-first smart task manager built using pure web technologies, designed with strong architecture, performance, and scalability in mind.

This project focuses on creating a highly responsive, efficient, and intuitive task management experience while maintaining clean structure and future expandability.

---

## Vision

The goal of this project is not just to create a task manager, but to design a solid, scalable foundation that demonstrates real-world frontend architecture, state handling, and browser storage systems.

This project prioritizes:

- Performance
- Offline capability
- Clean architecture
- Responsive UI/UX
- Future scalability

## Core Features (Planned & In Progress)

### Task Management
- Create, edit, delete tasks
- Mark tasks as favourite
- Draft tasks support
- Smart filtering and sorting
- Popular/relevant task grouping (planned)

### Search System
- Fast task search
- Indexed filtering
- Instant UI response

### Storage Architecture
- IndexedDB for task storage (primary database)
- LocalStorage for personal settings and lightweight data
- Offline-first design
- No backend required

### UI/UX
- Fully responsive design (Mobile + Desktop)
- Grid + Flex hybrid layout system
- Modern gradient-based UI
- Optimized layout structure
- Edge cases handled from the beginning

---

## Current Development Status

### Completed
- Core layout structure
- Responsive Grid/Flex hybrid system
- Mobile and Desktop layout support
- UI foundation and component structure
- CSS architecture and responsiveness planning

### In Progress
- UI refinement
- Component stabilization
- Layout optimization

### Planned Next
- IndexedDB integration
- Task data layer implementation
- State handling logic
- Search functionality
- Interaction system

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Variables, Responsive Design)
- JavaScript (Planned)
- IndexedDB (Planned)
- LocalStorage

No frameworks. Pure web technologies for maximum control and learning.

---

## Architecture Philosophy

This project follows an architecture-first approach:

- UI structure before logic
- Data layer separation
- Storage abstraction planning
- Future backend compatibility
- Scalable component structure

This ensures the project remains maintainable, extendable, and production-ready.

---

## Performance Goals

- Fast load time
- Minimal JavaScript overhead
- Efficient storage handling
- Smooth UI rendering
- Mobile-first optimization

---

## Future Plans

- Smart task prioritization
- Drag and drop
- Notifications/reminders
- Cloud sync support
- Backend integration option
- Progressive Web App (PWA)

---

## Purpose

This project serves both as:

- A real productivity tool
- A demonstration of industrial-level frontend architecture using pure web technologies

---

## Author

Built as part of a deep learning journey into professional frontend and full-stack development.
